    "The goals / steps of this project are the following:\n",
    "* Make a pipeline that finds lane lines on the road\n",
    "* Reflect on your work in a written report\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Rubric specification\n",
    "    1. The output must be an annotated version of the input video\n",
    "    2. Annotation of left and right lane lines\n",
    "    3. Visually full extend of lane lines are covered\n",

    "### Reflection\n",
    "\n",
    "I really enjoyed the project. The classes were upto providing a clear understanding of the problem. I also got useful help from **Knowledge Section**, an answer by mentor ```Mr. Mate B ```helped compeleting the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "My pipline can be divided into 2 sections and 6 steps.<br><br>\n",
    "In first section,<br>\n",
    "   * we take the image (frames in a video) and change it to a gray scale image. ```cv2.cvtColor()```<br>\n",
    "   * The gray scale image is again smoothened with Gaussian Blurring.```cv2.GaussianBlur()```<br>\n",
    "   * That image is given to Canny Edge Detection.```cv2.Canny()```<br>\n",
    "   Now we have to work on finding the lane lines.<br>\n",
    "   Upto this was easy and from the lectures.<br><br>\n",
    "   Image can be found at [Canny Output](./test_images/test_images_output/out1.jpg)<br>\n",
    "   <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "In second section, <br>\n",
    "   * The image with edges is processed to take only the portion with the lane lines and quadrilateral masking function is used to do that.<br>```cv2.bitwise_and()``` function is used where 'image' and 'mask' is given as input and mask is the portion selected from image according to quadrilateral<br>\n",
    "    Region selected from the Canny output can be found at [Masked Ouput](./test_images/test_images_output/out2.jpg)<br>\n",
    "   * The masked region is the given to Hough Transform function to find lines corresponding to points (points in the line is given as output) ```cv2.HoughLinesP()```<br>\n",
    "   * The points from line is given to ```draw_lines()``` function to draw line on lane lines in image<br>\n",
    "    \n",
    " The output from 'draw_lines()' function is combined with original image to get the lane lines annotated. <br>\n",
    " The ```cv2.addWeighted()``` is used to annotate the original image.\n",
    "    ![alt text][image3]\n",
    "    \n",
    "  ### draw_lines()\n",
    "  \n",
    "  This function is created by some help from a blog describing use of ```np.polyfit()``` in Linear Regression<br>\n",
    "  Input : points returned by Hough function . The preprocessing steps involved:\n",
    "  \n",
    "      1. The points from Hough Transformation is selected according to **slope** (slope_threshold is used to discard lines).\n",
    "      2. The points (belongs to line) are then classified to **left lane line points** and **right lane line points**\n",
    "      3. **Linear Regression** is used to find parameters of line fitting the lane lines ```np.ployfit()```\n",
    "      4. The parameters then found is used to give lower and upper end points of lane lines\n",
    "      5. The lines are drawn using ```cv2.line()```<br>\n",
    "    The left and right lane lines are drawn seperately<br>\n",
    "    <br>\n",
    "    Vectors are used to create the line for lane lines but their performance was poorer in videos.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Identify potential shortcomings with your current pipeline\n",
    "    \n",
    "    1. The lines shivers in the video.\n",
    "    2. Curves are not possible to annotate. \n",
    "    3. Video with a different size and conditions fails in this pipeline (Challenge video)\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Suggest possible improvements to your pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Automate pipeline according to changing image properties. (inferring masking area - vertices) \n",
    "    2. Improve the 'draw_lines()' to remove shaking in subsequent video frames, by averaging changes to coordinates in these frames.\n",
